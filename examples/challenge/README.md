# Camunda SpaceTraders Challenge Process

This folder contains a BPMN process for the Camunda SpaceTraders challenge. It uses the [SDK](../../sdk) to track the
progress of the player and share it.

The process has a start form to create a new instance. The start form takes the SpaceTraders token to get the player
status.

ðŸš§ Currently, the process post the player status as Slack messages. In the final state, the messages should be published
in the Camunda forum.

## Usage

1. Set the following connector secrets:

```
SLACK_TOKEN // the Slack token to publish the messages with
SLACK_CHANNEL // the Slack channel to publish the messages to
```

2. Deploy the process
3. Copy the publication link of the process start form
